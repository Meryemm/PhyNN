# PhyNN

### Very much a work in progress but if you want to try it out... 

Activate the conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml` then `source activate phynn`

Modify the settings in `src/phynn.py` to your liking: _number of sites/sequences/trees, NN parameters, evolutionary regime_
(or leave as is) 

Run it: `python3 src/phynn.py`
