#TODO:
# Need to get the "fuzzy" topology/distance matrices to newick functions written
# This would then just wrap the trained keras models in pre and post processing
# Pre: convert fasta to one-hot-encoded matrix
# Post: unflatten the two matrices; create topology (i.e. newick structure without branch lengths); add branch lengths
